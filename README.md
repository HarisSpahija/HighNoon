<h2>Composition</h2>
My composition is shown above in my UML

<h2>Encapsulation</h2>
I used public and private keywords to re-use the same keywords. This way I was able to make a more organized code.

<h2>Inheritance</h2>
I used the targets for inheritance, I was planning on adding more guns so I could use inheritance for that aswell.
